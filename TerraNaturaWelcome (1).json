If you made this mistake please contact an admin on Discord for it to be changed.\n- You must create a tribe even if you are solo.\n\nBEHAVIOUR AND COMMON COURTESY\n- Do not pick players up on a flyer with intent to harm them.\n- Do not harass, stalk or be abusive towards any player.\n- Use of racist or highly offensive language in chat will result in a ban.\n\nBUILDS, BASES AND TAMES\n- Pick up all traps after use.\n- Keep your base within a (TBC) foundation radius in all directions.\n- One base per tribe per map. This includes water pens, we plan on adding a public water pen for all to use.\n- Keep our obelisks and community centres free from tames, storage boxes etc.\n- Do not block access to artifact caves, high resource spawns or anywhere players need to go.\n\nDiscord is not a requirement but joining and registering will serve as your insurance. http://discord.gg/Z9vv88GykB.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nUnregistered or incorrectly registered rule-breakers will not be warned by admin, instead we will take action without contacting you. This could mean we destroy your tames left at a cave entrance, we destroy a second base or we wipe you completely if the issues are severe enough. This is because we don't want to waste our time chasing rule-breakers when we could simply send you a polite message on Discord or speak with you in a ticket.",
